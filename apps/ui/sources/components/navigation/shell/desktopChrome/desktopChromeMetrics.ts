/**
 * One glyph size for every icon in the desktop sidebar chrome: the top strip, and the collapsed
 * rail's toggle, which is the same control in its other state.
 *
 * These were 15/13/18 across three constants -- hand-measured corrections from when this row mixed
 * Ionicons and Octicons, which are drawn to different grids, so matching their declared sizes did not
 * match their ink. Behind a single-family seam the corrections are noise, and collapsing them was
 * right; taking the app's DEFAULT size as the survivor was not. This strip is window chrome, sitting
 * beside 12px traffic lights, and at 20 the glyphs exactly filled their 20px buttons -- no padding
 * anywhere in the row. It is the compact step, and the button boxes stay where they are so the
 * glyphs finally have air around them.
