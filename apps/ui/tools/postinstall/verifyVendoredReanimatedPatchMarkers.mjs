/**
 * Integrity gate for the vendored `react-native-reanimated` settled-updates patch.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The patch carries ONE behaviour hunk, and it fails SILENTLY when the hunk is lost: an animated
 * value gets stuck at a stale height/offset and no first-party test can observe it, because the
 * defect lives in a dependency's C++ reached through a native timer race. `patch-package`
 * regenerates a patch from whatever is in `node_modules` at the time, so a regeneration performed
 * against a partially-reverted tree drops hunks with no error and exit 0. That failure mode already
 * fired in this checkout: something re-ran `patch-package` mid-build.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHY IT ASSERTS THE INSTALLED ARTIFACT
 * Asserting the `.patch` FILE's text is worthless — it reads the same whether or not the patch was
 * applied. This gate reads the installed `node_modules` sources instead: pure `fs`, no external
 * binary, same answer on every platform (Windows is first-class here, so `patch(1)` is not
 * available to us). It answers the only question that matters: "is the fix installed, and is it
 * live".
 *
 * "LIVE" is a real second question. The whole settled-updates mechanism — the defect AND the fix —
 * is inert unless the `FORCE_REACT_RENDER_FOR_SETTLED_ANIMATIONS` static feature flag is on, because
 * that flag gates the `timestampMap_` write in `AnimatedPropsRegistry::update` inside an
 * `if constexpr`. With the flag off, nothing is ever timestamped, `getUpdatesOlderThanTimestamp`
 * matches nothing, and the call ordering this gate protects has no observable consequence. A future
 * flip of that flag would therefore silently retire the fix. It is checkable from first-party bytes,
 * so this gate checks it rather than merely documenting it — see {@link SETTLED_ANIMATIONS_FLAG}.
 *
 * LOUD ON UPSTREAM DRIFT
 * Every check fails rather than skips when the symbol, file, or flag it names is absent. An upstream
 * bump that renames `getSettledUpdates`, moves the registry write, or drops the flag must stop the
 * install so a human re-derives the fix, not quietly certify a tree that no longer contains it.
